# Bamazon Store Inventory App

This app - at it's fullest potential - is an Amazon-like storefront powered by MySQL. The app will show store's inventory and then ask for a customer's order. Once the customer has placed an order, the app will deplete stock from the store's inventory. The store inventory is logged in a MySql database.
